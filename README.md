<P class="p10 ft6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time of Flight, Structured light and Stereo technology have been used widely for 
Depth Map estimation. Each have these come with their own pros and cons in terms of speed of image capture, structural description and 
ambient light performance. Monocular cues such as: Texture and Gradient Variation, Shading , color/Haze, and defocus aid in accurate 
depth estimation. These are complex statistical models which are susceptible to noise. Recently, data driven approaches as in deep learning 
has been employed for depth estimation. These data driven approaches are less prone to noise if presented with enough data to learn coarser
and finer details.

<P class="p9 ft6"><H2> Convolution Neural Networks - CNN </H2></P>
<P class="p12 ft6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In deep learning, CNNs are widely used in the image processing applications. Convolution layers are the basic building block of CNN and it combines with Pooling and ReLU activation layers. Kernel learns during each layer using back propagation.The CNN learns the features from the input images by applying the varied filters across the image generating feature maps at each layer. As we go deeper into the network the feature maps are able to identify complex features and objects intuitively. ConvNets have been very successful for image classification, but recently have been used for image prediction and other applications. The addition of upscaling and deconvolution layers have given way to upscale the compressed feature map for data prediction over class.
